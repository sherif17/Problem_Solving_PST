# Problem Statement
In the square table n × n find the sum of integers at the main and at the secondary diagonal.

## Constraints
---


## Input
----
First line contains the size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) of the matrix. Next lines describe a matrix n × n. The elements of the matrix are not greater than 105 by absolute value. To understand how each diagonal is called, look at the second sample.

## Output
---
Print the sum of integers at main and secondary diagonal.
