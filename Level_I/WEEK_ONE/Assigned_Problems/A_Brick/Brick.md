# Problem Statement
We have a truck, which can carry at most 
**N**
 kilograms.

We will load bricks onto this truck, each of which weighs 
W
 kilograms. At most how many bricks can be loaded?

 ## Constraints
 ---
 * 1
≤
N
,
W
≤
1000

* N
 and 
W
 are integers.

 ## Input
---
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

>**N W**

## Output
---
Print an integer representing the maximum number of bricks that can be loaded onto the truck.

## Sample Input 1
---
>**10 3**

## Sample Output 1
----
>**3**

Each brick weighs 
**3**
 kilograms, so 
**3**
 bricks weigh 
**9**
 kilograms, and 
**4**
 weigh 
**12**
 kilograms.

Thus, we can load at most 
3
 bricks onto the truck that can carry at most 
10
 kilograms.
