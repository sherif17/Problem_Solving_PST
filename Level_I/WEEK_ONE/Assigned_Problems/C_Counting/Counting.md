# Problem Statement
How many integers not less than 
A
 and not more than 
B
 are there?


 ## Constraints
 ---
* 1
≤
A
≤
100

* 1
≤
B
≤
100

* A
 and 
B
 are integers.

 ## Input
---
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

>**A B**

## Output
---
Print the number of integers not less than 
**A**
 and not more than 
**B**
.

## Sample Input 1
---
>**2 4**

## Sample Output 1
----
>**3**

## Sample Input 2
---
>**10 100**

## Sample Output 2
----
>**91**

## Sample Input 3
---
>**3 2**

## Sample Output 3
----
>**0**


 We have no integers not less than 
3
 and not more than 
2
, so we should print 
0
.
