# Problem Statement
Given an integer 
a
 as input, print the value 
a
+
a^2
+
a^3.

## Constraints
---
* 1
≤
a
≤
10
* a is an integer.

## Input
-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

a
## Output
---------
Print the value 
a
+
a^2
+
a^3
 as an integer.
 
## Sample Input 1
---
2

## Sample Output 1
---
14
When 
a=2, we have a+a^2+a^3=2+2^2+2^3=2+4+8=14.

Print the answer as an input. Outputs such as 14.0 will be judged as incorrect.
