# Problem Statement
Given is an integer 
r
.

How many times is the area of a circle of radius 
r
 larger than the area of a circle of radius 
1
?

It can be proved that the answer is always an integer under the constraints given.

# Constraints
* 1
≦
N
≦
100

* All values in input are integers.


# Input 
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

r



# Output
Print the area of a circle of radius 
r
, divided by the area of a circle of radius 
1
, as an integer

# Sample Input 1
>2
# Sample Output 1
**4**
>The area of a circle of radius 
2
 is 
4
 times larger than the area of a circle of radius 
1
.

Note that output must be an integer - for example, 4.0 will not be accepted.




# Sample Input 2
100  

# Sample Output 2
**10000**
