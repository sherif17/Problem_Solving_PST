Print the integers contained in the boxes 
A
, 
B
, and 
C
, in this order, with space in between.

### Sample Input 1
----
> **1 2 3**

### Sample Output  1
----
> **3 1 2**

### Notes

A
 and 
B
 are swapped, 
A
, 
B
, and 
C
 contain 
2
, 
1
, and 
3
, respectively.
Then, after the contents of 
A
 and 
C
 are swapped, 
A
, 
B
, and 
C
 contain 
3
, 
1
, and 
2
, respectively.
