# Problem Statement
You are given a three-digit positive integer 
N
.
Determine whether 
N
 is a palindromic number.
Here, a palindromic number is an integer that reads the same backward as forward in decimal notation.

## Constraints
---
* 100
≤
N
≤
999
* N
 is an integer.

## Input
----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N


## Output
---
If 
N
 is a palindromic number, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

### Sample Input 1
----
> **  **

### Sample Output  1
----
> **575**
N=
575
  is also 
575
 when read backward, so it is a palindromic number. You should print Yes.


 ### Sample Input 2
----
> **123**



### Sample Output  2
----
> ** **

 ### Sample Input 3
----
> **No**
N
=
123
 becomes 
321
 when read backward, so it is not a palindromic number. You should print No.
### Sample Output  3
----
> **812**
