# Problem Statement
We have five variables 
x
1
,
x
2
,
x
3
,
x
4
,
 and 
x
5
.

The variable 
x
i
 was initially assigned a value of 
i
.

Snuke chose one of these variables and assigned it 
0
.

You are given the values of the five variables after this assignment.

Find out which variable Snuke assigned 
0
.



## Constraints
---
The values of 
x
1
,
x
2
,
x
3
,
x
4
,
 and 
x
5
 given as input are a possible outcome of the assignment by Snuke.

## Input
----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

x
1
 
x
2
 
x
3
 
x
4
 
x
5


## Output
---
If the variable Snuke assigned 
0
 was 
x
i
, print the integer 
i
.

### Sample Input 1
----
> **0 2 3 4 5**

### Sample Output  1
----
> **1**
In this case, Snuke assigned 
0
 to 
x
1
, so we should print 
1
.
 ### Sample Input 2
----
> **1 2 0 4 5**

### Sample Output  2
----
> **3**
