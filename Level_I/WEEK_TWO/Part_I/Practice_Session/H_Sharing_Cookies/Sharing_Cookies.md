# Problem Statement
Snuke is giving cookies to his three goats.

He has two cookie tins. One contains 
A
 cookies, and the other contains 
B
 cookies. He can thus give 
A
 cookies, 
B
 cookies or 
A
+
B
 cookies to his goats (he cannot open the tins).

Your task is to determine whether Snuke can give cookies to his three goats so that each of them can have the same number of cookies.


## Constraints
---
* 1
≤
A
,
B
≤
100

* Both 
A
 and 
B
 are integers

## Input
----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

A
 
B


## Output
---
If it is possible to give cookies so that each of the three goats can have the same number of cookies, print Possible; otherwise, print Impossible.

### Sample Input 1
----
> **4 5**

### Sample Output  1
----
> **Possible**

If Snuke gives nine cookies, each of the three goats can have three cookies.

 ### Sample Input 2
----
> **1 1**

### Sample Output  2
----
> **Impossible**

Since there are only two cookies, the three goats cannot have the same number of cookies no matter what Snuke gives to them.
