# Problem_Solving_PST

It is an extinsive bootcamp training in problem solving under supervesion of **Coach Mohamed Abd El-wahab**.

This Repo will include solutions for sheets & contests that will be assigned periodically.

## Repo Will Have 4 Main Directories

* [**Level I**](#Level_I)
* **Level II**
* **Level III**
* **Level V**

.
