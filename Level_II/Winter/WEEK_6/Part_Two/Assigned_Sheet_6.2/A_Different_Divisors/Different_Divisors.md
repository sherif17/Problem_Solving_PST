# Problem Statement
Positive integer xx is called divisor of positive integer yy, if yy is divisible by xx without remainder. For example, 11 is a divisor of 77 and 33 is not divisor of 88.

We gave you an integer dd and asked you to find the smallest positive integer aa, such that

aa has at least 44 divisors;
difference between any two divisors of aa is at least dd.

## Constraints
---


## Input
----
The first line contains a single integer tt (1 \leq t \leq 30001≤t≤3000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer dd (1 \leq d \leq 100001≤d≤10000).

## Output
---
For each test case print one integer aa — the answer for this test case.
