# Problem Statement
Given an array, your task is to find the k-th occurrence (from left to right) of an integer v. To make
the problem more difficult (and interesting!), you’ll have to answer m such queries.

## Constraints
---


## Input
----
There are several test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤
100, 000), the number of elements in the array, and the number of queries. The next line contains n
positive integers not larger than 1,000,000. Each of the following m lines contains two integer k and v
(1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ v ≤ 1, 000, 000). The input is terminated by end-of-file (EOF).

## Output
---
For each query, print the 1-based location of the occurrence. If there is no such element, output ‘0’
instead.


### Sample Input 1
----
> **8 4
1 3 2 2 4 3 2 1
1 3
2 4
3 2
4 2**

### Sample Output  1
