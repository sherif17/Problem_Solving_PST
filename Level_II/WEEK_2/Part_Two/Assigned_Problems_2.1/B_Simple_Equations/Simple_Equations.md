# Problem Statement
Let us look at a boring mathematics problem. :-)
We have three different integers, x, y and z, which satisfy the following three relations:
• x + y + z = A
• xyz = B
• x
2 + y
2 + z
2 = C
You are asked to write a program that solves for x, y and z for given values of A, B and C.

## Constraints
---


## Input
----
The first line of the input file gives the number of test cases N (N < 20). Each of the following N lines
gives the values of A, B and C (1 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 10000)


## Output
---
For each test case, output the corresponding values of x, y and z. If there are many possible answers,
choose the one with the least value of x. If there is a tie, output the one with the least value of y.
If there is no solution, output the line ‘No solution.’ instead.

### Sample Input 1
----
> **2
1 2 3
6 6 14

### Sample Output  1
----
> ** **
> No solution.
