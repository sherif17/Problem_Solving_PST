# Problem Statement
Well, here is another math class task. In mathematics, GCD is the greatest common divisor, and it's an easy task to calculate the GCD between two positive integers.

A common divisor for two positive numbers is a number which both numbers are divisible by.

But your teacher wants to give you a harder task, in this task you have to find the greatest common divisor d between two integers a and b that is in a given range from low to high (inclusive), i.e. low ≤ d ≤ high. It is possible that there is no common divisor in the given range.

You will be given the two integers a and b, then n queries. Each query is a range from low to high and you have to answer each query.

## Constraints
---
The first line contains two integers a and b, the two integers as described above (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 109). The second line contains one integer n, the number of queries (1 ≤ n ≤ 104). Then n lines follow, each line contains one query consisting of two integers, low and high (1 ≤ low ≤ high ≤ 109).

## Input
----
Print n lines. The i-th of them should contain the result of the i-th query in the input. If there is no common divisor in the given range for any query, you should print -1 as a result for this query.

## Output
---


### Sample Input 1
----
> **9 27
3
1 5
10 11
9 11**

### Sample Output  1
----
> **3
-1
9**
