# Problem Statement
Calculate
R := B
P mod M
for large values of B, P, and M using an efficient algorithm. (Thatâ€™s right, this problem has a time
dependency !!!.

## Input
----
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below. Consecutive test cases are
separated by a single blank line.
Three integer values (in the order B, P, M) will be read one number per line. B and P are integers
in the range 0 to 2147483647 inclusive. M is an integer in the range 1 to 46340 inclusive.
